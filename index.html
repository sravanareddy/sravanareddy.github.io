  <h4>Abstract</h4><p>
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is reaching further and further
  into everyday life with Apple's Siri, Google voice search, automated
  telephone information systems, dictation devices, closed captioning,
  and other applications. Along with such advances in speech
  technology, sociolinguists have been considering new methods for
  alignment and vowel formant extraction, including techniques like
  the Penn Aligner (Yuan and Liberman, 2008) and the FAVE automated
  vowel extraction program (Evanini et al., 2009, Rosenfelder et al.,
  2011). With humans transcribing audio recordings into sen- tences,
  these semi-automated methods can produce effective vowel formant
  measure- ments (Labov et al., 2013). But as the quality of ASR
  improves, sociolinguistics may be on the brink of another
  transformative technology: large-scale, completely automated vowel
  extraction without any need for human transcription. It would then
  be possible to quickly extract vowels from virtually limitless hours
  of recordings, such as YouTube, publicly available audio/video
  archives, and large-scale personal interviews or streaming
  video. How far away is this transformative moment? In this article,
  we introduce a fully automated program called DARLA (short for
  "Dartmouth Linguistic Automation,"
  <a href="http://darla.dartmouth.edu"
  target"_blank">http://darla.dartmouth.edu</a>),
  which automatically generates transcriptions with ASR and extracts vowels using FAVE. Users simply upload an audio recording of speech, and DARLA produces vowel plots, a table of vowel formants, and probabilities of the phonetic environments for each token. In this paper, we describe DARLA and explore its sociolinguistic applications. We test the system on a dataset of the US Southern Shift and compare the results with semi-automated methods.

  <h4>Abstract</h4><p>
Sociolinguists are regularly faced with the task of measuring phonetic features from speech, which involves manually transcribing audio recordings -- a major bottleneck to analyzing large collections of data. We harness automatic speech recognition to build an online end-to-end web application where users upload untranscribed speech collections and receive formant measurements of the vowels in their data. We demonstrate this tool by using it to automatically analyze President Barack Obamaâ€™s vowel pronunciations.

There has been recent interest in the problem of decoding letter substitution ciphers using techniques inspired by natural language processing. We consider a different type of classical encoding scheme known as the running key cipher, and propose a search solution using Gibbs sampling with a word language model. We evaluate our method on synthetic ciphertexts of different lengths, and find that it outperforms previous work that employs Viterbi

We introduce the problem of learning pronunciations of out-of-vocabulary words from word recognition mistakes made by an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. This question is especially relevant in cases where the  ASR engine is a black box -- meaning that the only acoustic cues about the speech data come from the word recognition outputs. This paper presents an expectation maximization approach to inferring pronunciations from ASR word recognition hypotheses, which outperforms pronunciation estimates of a state of the art grapheme-to-phoneme system.</blockquote>

We address a key problem in grapheme-to-phoneme conversion: the ambiguity in mapping grapheme units to phonemes. Rather than using single letters and phonemes as units, we propose learning chunks, or subwords, to reduce ambiguity. This can be interpreted as learning a lexicon of subwords that has minimum description length. We implement an algorithm to build such a lexicon, as well as a simple decoder that uses these subwords.

  <h4>Abstract</h4><p>
The pronunciation of a word represented in an alphabetic writing system (such as this one) is relatively transparent -- but a language's sounds change over time and vary across space, while its spellings remain relatively static, resulting in some amount of divergence between the written and spoken forms. The introduction of loanwords and proper names from other languages with different phonologies and scripts further complicates the relationship between orthography and pronunciation. <p>

However, there are sources of information about the sound of a word in addition to spelling. 
This dissertation presents methods for learning pronunciations using three forms of evidence: speech, word origins, and rhymes.<p>

Speech is the most natural source of evidence: a word's pronunciation is usually clarified upon hearing it in a spoken utterance.  In the case of proper names, knowing the linguistic or ethnic origin of the name is often instrumental in determining how it should be pronounced. Rhymes in poems or songs also provide a cue to pronunciation, particularly for inferring the sound of a word at an earlier point in history.<p>

Using extra-orthographic evidence in a computational model necessitates access to data that provides this information in sufficiently large quantities. Collecting annotated data -- speech labeled with the words that it contains, names with their ethnic origins, or poetry with rhyming patterns -- can be extremely difficult and expensive. On the other hand, raw data -- speech recordings, lists of names, archives of poetry -- is available in plenty. The focus of this dissertation is, therefore, on using unlabeled data for pronunciation learning. <p>

There are two facets of 'pronunciation learning' in this work. One is that of converting the written form of a word to its phonemic representation, known as grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. The other is a less fine-grained objective: rather than learning the exact phonemic forms, we aim to discover clusters of words with similar pronunciations.<p>

The first contribution of this dissertation is a model to incorporate untranscribed spoken data, in addition to an existing lexicon of words and their pronunciations, into a grapheme-to-phoneme learner. This approach is found to improve over models that are trained only on a lexicon. The second contribution is an algorithm that models the latent linguistic origins of names as part of  grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. Not only does this method do better than a model without word origin awareness, it also outperforms existing approaches that first classify orthographic words by origin in a supervised manner, and then train language-specific pronunciation models. The final contribution is an unsupervised learner that discovers the rhyme schemes of stanzas of poetry, as well as rhyming relations between words and clusters of words with a common rhyming sound.

Unsupervised part-of-speech induction involves the discovery of syntactic categories in a text, 
given no additional information other than the text itself. One requirement of an induction 
system is the ability to handle multiple categories for each word, in order to deal with word 
sense ambiguity. We construct an algorithm for unsupervised part-of-speech induction, treating 
the problem as one of soft clustering. The key technical component of the algorithm is the 
application of the recently developed technique of non-negative matrix factorization to the task 
of category discovery, using word contexts and morphology as syntactic cues.
