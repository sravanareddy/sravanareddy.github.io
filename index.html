Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is reaching further and further
  into everyday life with Apple's Siri, Google voice search, automated
  telephone information systems, dictation devices, closed captioning,
  and other applications. Along with such advances in speech
  technology, sociolinguists have been considering new methods for
  alignment and vowel formant extraction, including techniques like
  the Penn Aligner (Yuan and Liberman, 2008) and the FAVE automated
  vowel extraction program (Evanini et al., 2009, Rosenfelder et al.,
  2011). With humans transcribing audio recordings into sen- tences,
  these semi-automated methods can produce effective vowel formant
  measure- ments (Labov et al., 2013). But as the quality of ASR
  improves, sociolinguistics may be on the brink of another
  transformative technology: large-scale, completely automated vowel
  extraction without any need for human transcription. It would then
  be possible to quickly extract vowels from virtually limitless hours
  of recordings, such as YouTube, publicly available audio/video
  archives, and large-scale personal interviews or streaming
  video. How far away is this transformative moment? In this article,
  we introduce a fully automated program called DARLA (short for
  "Dartmouth Linguistic Automation,"
  <a href="http://darla.dartmouth.edu"
  target"_blank">http://darla.dartmouth.edu</a>),
  which automatically generates transcriptions with ASR and extracts vowels using FAVE. Users simply upload an audio recording of speech, and DARLA produces vowel plots, a table of vowel formants, and probabilities of the phonetic environments for each token. In this paper, we describe DARLA and explore its sociolinguistic applications. We test the system on a dataset of the US Southern Shift and compare the results with semi-automated methods.

Sociolinguists are regularly faced with the task of measuring phonetic
	    features from speech, which involves manually transcribing
	    audio recordings -- a major bottleneck to analyzing large
	    collections of data. We harness automatic speech
	    recognition to build an online end-to-end web application
	    where users upload untranscribed speech collections and
	    receive formant measurements of the vowels in their
	    data. We demonstrate this tool by using it to
	    automatically analyze President Barack Obamaâ€™s vowel
	    pronunciations.	  </div>

There has been recent interest in the problem of decoding letter substitution ciphers using techniques inspired by natural language processing. We consider a different type of classical encoding scheme known as the running key cipher, and propose a search solution using Gibbs sampling with a word language model. We evaluate our method on synthetic ciphertexts of different lengths, and find that it outperforms previous work that employs Viterbi 
decoding with character-based models.

We introduce the problem of learning pronunciations of out-of-vocabulary words from word recognition mistakes made by an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. This question is especially relevant in cases where the  ASR engine is a black box -- meaning that the only acoustic cues about the speech data come from the word recognition outputs. This paper presents an expectation maximization approach to inferring pronunciations from ASR word recognition hypotheses, which outperforms pronunciation estimates of a state of the art grapheme-to-phoneme system.	  </div>

We address a key problem in grapheme-to-phoneme conversion: the ambiguity in mapping grapheme units to phonemes. Rather than using single letters and phonemes as units, we propose learning chunks, or subwords, to reduce ambiguity. This can be interpreted as learning a lexicon of subwords that has minimum description length. We implement an algorithm to build such a lexicon, as well as a simple decoder that uses these subwords.  </div>

An eggcorn is a type of linguistic error where a word is substituted with one that is semantically plausible -- that is, the substitution is a semantic reanalysis of what may be a rare, archaic, or otherwise opaque term. We build a system that, given the original word and its eggcorn form, finds a semantic path between the two. Based on these paths, we derive a typology that reflects the different classes of semantic reinterpretation underlying eggcorns.

Large-scale digitization of manuscripts is facilitated by
    high-accuracy optical character recognition (OCR) engines. The
    focus of our work is on using these tools to digitize Latin
    texts. Many of the texts in the language, especially the early
    modern, make heavy use of special characters like ligatures and
    accented abbreviations. Current OCRs are inadequate for our
    purpose: their built-in training sets do not include all these
    special characters, and further, post-processing of OCR output is
    based on data and methods specific to the domain language, most of
    the current systems do not implement error-correction tools for
    Latin. This abstract outlines the development of a document
    recognition system for medieval and early modern Latin texts. We
    first evaluate the performance of the open source OCR framework,
    Gamera, on these manuscripts. We then incorporate language
    modeling functions to sharpen the character recognition output.

  Unsupervised part-of-speech induction involves the discovery of  
syntactic categories in a text, given no additional information other  
than the text itself.  One requirement of an induction system is the  
ability to handle multiple categories for each word, in order to deal  
with word sense ambiguity.  We construct an algorithm for unsupervised  
part-of-speech induction, treating the problem as one of soft  
clustering.  The key technical component of the algorithm is the  
application of the recently developed technique of non-negative matrix  
factorization to the task of category discovery, using word contexts
