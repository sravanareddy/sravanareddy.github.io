  <em>Abstract</em><br>
    As experimentation in the behavioral and social sciences moves from brick-and-mortar
  laboratories to the web, new opportunities arise in the design of experiments.
  By taking advantage of the new medium, experimenters can write complex computationally
  mediated adaptive procedures for gathering data: algorithms.
  This talk explores the consequences of adopting an algorithmic approach to experiment design.
  I'll review several experiment designs drawn from the fields of medicine,
  cognitive psychology, and psychophysics, describing their interpretation as algorithms.
  I'll then discuss Dallinger, a software platform for efficient execution of these algorithms with people.
  Finally, I'll sketch out a vision for next-generation experimentation in the behavioral and social sciences:
  high-throughput automation via culture-on-a-chip computing.

    <strong>Community Wellness Informatics: Creating Technology for Health Equity</strong><br>

  <em>Abstract</em><br>
    In the U.S., there are serious and persistent disparities in health outcomes.
    Socioeconomic status is predictive of mortality and disease, with low-SES
    households dispropotionately experiencing the poorest health outcomes.
    This inequality is due in large part to <em>social determinants of health</em> --
    social, physical, and economic conditions that make it more challenging to achieve
    wellness in low-SES communities.
    Disruptive innovations are sorely needed to reduce health disparities.
  <br><br>
    Technology, with its growing ubiquity and ability to provide engaging,
    informative, and empowering experiences for people,
    presents exciting opportunities for health equity research.
    This talk will present a set of case studies demonstrating how the
    Wellness Technology Lab is pursuing technology-driven social change
    through health promotion.
    These case studies explore how social computing and mobile technology
    can help low-SES communities both cope with barriers to wellness and
    address these barriers directly.

    <strong>Secure Stable Matchings</strong><br>
     <a class="btn btn-xs btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse"
    data-target="#ashelat16" aria-expanded="false" role="button">abstract and bio</a>
    <br>

<div id="ashelat16" class="bg-warning collapse abstract colloqabstract">
<p>
<em>Abstract</em><br>
When a group of individuals and organizations wish to compute a stable matching --
for example, when medical students are matched to medical residency programs --
they often outsource the computation to a trusted arbiter in order to preserve the
privacy of participants' preferences.
Secure multi-party computation offers the possibility of private matching processes
that do not rely on any common trusted third party.
However, stable matching algorithms have previously been considered infeasible for
execution in a secure multi-party context on non-trivial inputs because they are
computationally intensive and involve complex data-dependent memory access patterns.
<br><br>
In this talk, I will explain how we can use 2-party computation to securely compute
stable matchings on instances the size of the 2016 NRMP medical residency matching
in less than 1 day.
Prior work on this problem was stuck on toy instances involving a few hundred participants.
The insight is to exploit an algorithmic property of matchings and design a new secure
computation data structure.

    <strong>Awareness, Coordination and Trust in the Peer Economy</strong><br>

     <em>Abstract</em><br>
Communities in urban environments, and underserved communities in particular,
could benefit from the positive economic and social outcomes offered via
collaborative consumption services.
Technology can support collaborative consumption (sometimes called "peer economy")
by providing important enablers such as awareness, coordination
and trust between individuals.
I will briefly describe a number of projects we are
currently working on to develop technology to provide,
and techniques to understand these enablers.
I will spend most of my time on the topic of trust, describing a mixed-methods
study in which we examine how hosts describe themselves on their Airbnb profile pages.
The results show the imapct of the host's self disclosure on their trustworthiness,
and have important design implications for collaborative consumption platforms.

<strong>Dialectal variation in social media: A case study of African-American English</strong><br>

  <em>Abstract</em><br>
  The growth of social media presents rich opportunities for social analysis,
  ranging from politics and market trends to public health.
  Among the challenges that social media text presents to natural language processing,
  however, is the abundance of dialectal language.
  This talk explores our investigation of the use of one such dialect,
  African-American English (AAE), on Twitter.
  I will talk about a model we developed to identify AAE-like language from tweets and
  the linguistic challenges associated with creating the first broad corpus of such tweets.
  I will also talk about experiments that show that current NLP tools perform poorly
  on such text compared to text associated with white speakers,
  and the consequences of such bias for a variety of NLP tasks.
  Finally, I will talk about one approach to eliminating this bias.

  <strong>Continuous Vector Representations of (Spoken and Written) Words</strong><br>

  <em>Abstract</em><br>
  This talk is an overview of some of the research at TTI-Chicago in the area of speech and language processing.
  I will focus mainly on the topic of word embeddings, a way of representing a word using a vector of
  continuous-valued numbers.
  We can think of each of the vector dimensions as representing some aspect of the word,
  and we can try to assign vectors to words so that similar words have similar vectors.
  Such word embeddings have been useful in a variety of natural language processing applications.
<br><br>
  I will talk about both <em>semantic</em> word embeddings
  (where the vector is intended to represent the meaning of the word),
  and <em>acoustic</em> word embeddings (where the vector represents the way the word sounds).
  The talk addresses a number of questions related to this line of work:
  How do we automatically learn word embeddings from data,
  such that they are useful for applications that we care about?
  What do these vectors look like?
  And how can we combine word embeddings to form, say, phrase or sentence vectors?
  <br><br>
  In addition, I will give a brief overview of TTI-Chicago and our PhD program,
  as well as a few remarks about my experience as a female researcher.
